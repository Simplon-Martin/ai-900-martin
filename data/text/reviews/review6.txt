Cresci, Cannes, France
3/2/2018
Passing through Cannes for the day, we wanted to eat a pizza on the terrace on the port. What was our amazement when the head waiter turned us back at the entrance. We were 2 adults and 1 handicapped child with his dog, a labrador. (Dog which is still associated with the blind). We were refused because of the dog, when we had asked for a table apart so as not to disturb anyone. It's a shame. One can ask the question who was refused, the disabled person or his dog.
